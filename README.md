## Rockets' Land Project

This is a project whose name is Rockets' Land as I am fascinated by the infrastructure of the rockets which is why I have chosed this project.This project is made using Bootstrap to make it responsive.Rockets Land is an exciting project built on SpaceX API using React functional components and hooks. This project provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to explore and discover information about various categories of rockets.

Through Rockets Land, users can navigate through different rocket categories, such as Falcon 1, Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy, and more. Each category offers detailed information about the rockets, including their specifications, launch history, and mission details.

The project harnesses the power of React functional components and hooks to create a dynamic and interactive user experience. Functional components provide a modular and reusable structure, while hooks enable the management of state and side effects within the components.

The interface is designed to be intuitive and visually appealing, ensuring a seamless browsing experience for users. The use of modern design techniques and responsive layouts ensures that Rockets Land is accessible and optimized for various devices and screen sizes.

By leveraging the SpaceX API, the project fetches real-time data and updates the information dynamically, allowing users to stay up-to-date with the latest rocket details and mission statuses. This integration with the API ensures that the project remains current and provides accurate and reliable information.

Rockets Land is not only a showcase of technical skills but also a demonstration of a passion for space exploration and a love for learning. It combines the thrill of exploring the wonders of rockets with the power of modern web development technologies.

In summary, Rockets Land is an engaging project built on React functional components and hooks, showcasing different categories of rockets using data from the SpaceX API. It offers an immersive user experience, providing comprehensive information about rockets and their missions. Whether you're a space enthusiast or simply curious about rocket technology, Rockets Land will take you on an exciting journey through the fascinating world of SpaceX rockets.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
